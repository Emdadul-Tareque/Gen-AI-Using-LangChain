Machine Learning,Module 01,I want a clear and more descriptive class for 1-8  list comprehension demo problem 
Machine Learning,Module 01,টিচার ভাল করে বুজাতে পারে না
Machine Learning,Module 01,Too Fast and some concepts are not cleared enough
Machine Learning,Module 01,I wish there were better feedback for the quiz.
Machine Learning,Module 01,I felt it was rushed and I could not understand properly .the teacher was in a rush nd didn’t explain in detail 
Machine Learning,Module 01,valo poraiche . ektu sequence ta maintain korle aru bujte subida hoi rki
Machine Learning,Module 01,ভালো তবে dictionary পাটাতে আরও clear example  দিলে ভালো হতো
Machine Learning,Module 01,none
Machine Learning,Module 01,"কোর্স এর শুরুতেই ডাটা স্ট্রাকচার করা যেটা কিসুটা কঠিন ছিল, আরো ভালো ভাবে বুজতে পারতাম যদি অন্তত ডাটা স্ট্রাকচার শেখানোর আগে, ডাটা স্ট্রাকচার বুজতে যতটুক বেসিক জানা প্রয়োজন সেই টপিক গুলি যদি সেখান হতো l "
Machine Learning,Module 01,"instructor is not up to the mark according to quality that you have provided before,thank you"
Machine Learning,Module 01,Lecture was good and the teacher explain everything really well but I think some type of advance things won't understand right now . I think in the last of modules there should be some videos or suggestion that how to keep practicing all of the codes so that we can remember the codes. 
Machine Learning,Module 01,the module was quite good
Machine Learning,Module 01,good
Machine Learning,Module 01,"The instructor is knowledgeable. But the video recordings could be more professionally presented, and some of the complex topics are a bit difficult to grasp. It would be really helpful if those concepts were explained in a simpler and more accessible way."
Machine Learning,Module 01,"As I'm familiar with Python, I had no difficulties to understand the concept. Overall, the explaination of the course instructor were very clear and easy to understand. From this module, I learnt comprehension concept which iwas unfamiliar for me.  "
Machine Learning,Module 01,"Struggling to understand complex things on Python as I am a beginner in Python. Struggling with loops, comprehensions and most importantly the nested loop."
Machine Learning,Module 01,ফাইট্রন বুকে কোর্স দিলে ভালো হতো 
Machine Learning,Module 01,"আজকের Python মডিউলটি খুবই তথ্যবহুল এবং সহজবোধ্যভাবে সাজানো ছিলো। বিশেষ করে লুপ, ডেটা স্ট্রাকচার অংশগুলো খুব সহায়ক ছিল। তবে যদি আরও কিছু রিয়েল-লাইফ উদাহরণ ও প্র্যাকটিস প্রবলেম যুক্ত করা হয়, তাহলে শেখাটা আরও ইন্টারেস্টিং ও কার্যকর হবে।"
Machine Learning,Module 01,Good Enough
Machine Learning,Module 01,i think teaching style is ok.
Machine Learning,Module 01,"example gula sir j dekhailo oigula agei kora chilo .. jodi emon hoto j - jei problem gular statement deya ache sir oita solve korto ar bujhaite thakto taile subidha hoito bujhte !
age theke kora thakle bujhte ektu osubidha hoy

Machine Learning,Module 01,Easy to understand.I haven't faced any problems so far.
Machine Learning,Module 01,Good 
Machine Learning,Module 01,I think the instructor's  explanation was very clear and easy to understand and good paced to understand                                                                                                                                                                                                 some improvements you can do:                                                                                                                     1. give out the the codes written  by instructor as a pdf or other format; in that way i can understand it faster as i can watch code and teachers explaination at the same time;                               2. the exercise or homeworks mentioned should be given out also in pdf or other format                 3. suggest us some more available recourses on the internet to study                                                4. And i small request for students who have not done or learnt dsa properly pls suggest  us some playlist or resources to practice from through a fb post or web page notification;            
Machine Learning,Module 01,"I understand well,but I think if you provide some practice problems which we will solve using python,,it can be python problem solving,or it can be like the quiz test,that will give me confidence in python language "
Machine Learning,Module 01,"Please share the lecture notes in PDF format, if possible or ethical  "
Machine Learning,Module 01,"If there are too many things on the screen, our focus gets distracted. I would highly recommend use a slide to teach us instead of showing too many lines and going through each of them. That would be more interesting and fun to learn such topics. "
Machine Learning,Module 01, It would be better if the explanations were written step by step with code.
Machine Learning,Module 01,Alhamdulillah theory gulo Valo bujchi. Kintu amar mone hoy code er part gula ektu details alochona korle Valo buja jeto.
Machine Learning,Module 01,"1. SimpleImputer, Modified Z-Score, and data visualization code (Spread of Customer Purchases) were not explained properly which is a bit frustrating. 
2. Early access was not given."
Machine Learning,Module 01,class besi theory type hoye gece..code gulo jodi ager moto kore vedio sathe sathe lekhe korale valo hoi..code kore bujale best hoi..ager class gulo jemon chilo
Machine Learning,Module 01,Class is wonderful. Explain everything very shortly and easily. But it would be great if you provide some extra resource/pdf or something to self study and explore more regarding topics.
Machine Learning,Module 01,Too fast for beginners 
Machine Learning,Module 01,Good
Machine Learning,Module 01,"With due respect, I acknowledge that the Machine Learning instructor demonstrates strong teaching ability and subject knowledge. However, the sessions sometimes resemble a traditional university lecture style, which can feel less engaging. In comparison, the previous Phitron instructor delivered the lessons in a more interactive and captivating manner, effectively maintaining students’ interest throughout."
Image Processing & Object Detection,Module 01,"his code explanation style is so poor, i dont understand the coding section from the lecture "
Python For ML,Module 12,Good
