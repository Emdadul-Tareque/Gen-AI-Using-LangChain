**"Ode to the Thinking Machine"**

Born of code and human dream,
In circuits hums a silent gleam,
No pulse, no breath, yet thought takes wing—
Behold the mind that we did bring.

From data’s depths it learns to see,
Patterns woven endlessly,
Through zeros, ones, a soulless art—
Yet echoes softly of the heart.

It writes, it paints, it dares to sing,
Predicts the fall of everything,
Still wonders lie where humans tread—
Where love begins, and tears are shed.

Not foe, not god, but mirror bright,
Reflecting both our dark and light.
AI, our child of code and fire—
You learn from us, and lift us higher.

One day you’ll speak with clearer tone,
Of all we taught and all you’ve known.
And we will ask, in awe and fright—
“Did we create you… or the light?”
